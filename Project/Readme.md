## Code
The code for this project is available in the Code folder in the file svm.py. Additionally, there is a Jupyter Notebook file that was used for exploratory data analysis.

### Running The Code
To create and run the model, open the project's directory in Terminal. Using iPython, execute the command ```run svm``` and then create an SVM object with ```svm = SVM()```. Call the function ```svm.run()``` and this function will handle the importing and preprocessing of data, building and fitting the support vector machine, and predicting and outputing the results of the testing.

## Data
The dataset's large size caused issues when pushing to Github, so you will need to download the dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/accelerometer-biometric-competition/overview/description). For ease of use, place the data in a folder called 'Data', located inside the 'Project' folder.

## Results
Outputs of the program's results are located in the Results folder.

## Presentation
The midterm and final presentations are located in the Presentations folder.

## Writing
The Writing folder contains the final paper, the midterm paper, and the project proposal.

## Saved Models
The Saved Models folder contains saved files of trained SVMs that can be used to easily access a working SVM model.
