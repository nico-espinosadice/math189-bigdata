To create and run the model, open the project's directory in Terminal. Using iPython, execute the command ```run svm``` and then create an SVM object with ```svm = SVM()```. Call the function ```svm.run()``` and this function will handle the importing and preprocessing of data, building and fitting the support vector machine, and predicting and outputing the results of the testing.

The dataset's large size caused issues when pushing to Github, so you will need to download the dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/accelerometer-biometric-competition/overview/description). For ease of use, place the data in a folder called 'Data', located inside the 'Project' folder.
